I am a full-stack developer with 9 years professional experience in the industry. I enjoy learning new tools and technologies, whether this is within a project or as an exploratory exercise. Primarily focused on web technologies, I believe that the strong foundation of open source these tools benefit from, make the platform an ideal place for fostering dialogue between people.

Interests

Away from the computer, I’m a keen cyclist and can often be found meandering around the lanes of Kent and Surrey thinking of longer rides. The longest to date being a single day ride between London and Somerset.

I’m also in the early stages of learning German, aber diese ist ein langsamer Prozess.
