I am a full-stack developer with 9 years experience in product and agency teams. I enjoy learning new tools and technologies. This could be part of a business critical project or exploratory research.

The most enjoyable projects to work on are those where I can take part from beginning to end. The starting point could be a loose collection of requirements or quick sketch. Working collaboratively to create something useful, that brings value to people.

## Interests

Away from the computer, I’m a keen cyclist and can often be found meandering around the Dutch polders looking for a hill to roll down. I enjoy longer endurance rides, the longest one to date being ~250km.

I’m also in the early stages of learning Dutch, maar het is langzaam proces
