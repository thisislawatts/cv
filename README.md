I am a full-stack developer with 15 years experience in product and agency environments. I thrive on learning new tools and technologies, whether for critical business projects or exploratory research.

I particularly enjoy projects where I can contribute from inception to completion, starting from loose requirements or a quick sketch and working collaboratively to create valuable and impactful solutions. I am happy working collaboratively or independently, my primary focus is on creating something useful that brings value to people.
